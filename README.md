# 📈 Network Baseline vs Attack Deviation Report

## 🧭 Project Summary

This project compares normal network behavior against attack traffic to identify anomalies and deviations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Capture baseline traffic
* Introduce attacks
* Compare behavior
* Document anomalies

---

## 🔍 Analysis Areas

* Connection rate
* Port usage
* Session duration
* Traffic patterns

---

## 📊 Key Insight

Attack traffic shows clear deviation from established baseline patterns.

---

## 🚨 Detection Value

Behavioral baselining is critical for modern SOC operations.

MITRE ATT&CK: T1046, T1071

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Statistical modeling
* UEBA integration
* Automated baselining
